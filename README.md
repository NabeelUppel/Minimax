Minimax Algorithm on the chess variant Congo.

There is 4 main implementations of the minimax algorithm:
1. Standard 
2. Alpha beta pruning 
3. Alpha beta pruning and Transposition Tables
4. Iterative Deepening

Running the program:
``g++ congo.cpp congo.h -o congo``
``./congo``

The game will be running with the minimax algorithm playing as white with  alpha beta pruning and will verse the machine that makes random moves.


NB. The Congo game is partially complete, there is two pieces missing, the crocodile and the monkey. This was an assignment and was I was instructed to forgo these pieces.
